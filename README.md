# Sales-Prediction


## Overview
This project is a Sales Forecasting Prediction system that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict future sales based on historical data. It helps businesses make data-driven decisions to optimize inventory, marketing, and financial planning.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
- Machine learning model selection and training
- Predictive analysis for future sales trends
- Visualization of sales trends and predictions

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sales-forecasting
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
The project uses a structured dataset containing sales records, including:
- Date
- Product category
- Sales volume
- Pricing
- Promotions/Discounts
- Seasonal trends

Ensure your dataset is placed in the `data/` directory before running the model.

## Usage
1. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```
4. View results and visualizations:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py
   ```

## Results
The model generates sales predictions based on input data and visualizes trends to help decision-making. Accuracy and performance metrics are included for evaluation.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a web dashboard for real-time analysis
- Deployment using Flask/Django
- Hyperparameter tuning for better model accuracy
